# Fuzzy Inference System for Credit Scoring

This project implements a fuzzy inference system for evaluating creditworthiness based on income and credit history.

## Description

The system uses fuzzy sets for income (low, medium, high) and credit score (low, high), with rules to determine risk level (low risk, high risk).

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the FuzzySet, FuzzyRule, and FuzzyInferenceSystem classes, and example usage.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 08_fuzzy_credit`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will compute and print the risk level for a sample input (income 40000, credit score 0.8).
