# Particle Swarm Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization

This project implements PSO and ACO for solving optimization problems, such as feature selection.

## Description

PSO simulates particle movement in search space, while ACO uses pheromone trails for path finding. Here, we implement PSO for feature selection.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the PSO implementation and example for feature selection.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python and NumPy are installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 11_pso_aco`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will run PSO and print the best feature subset found.
