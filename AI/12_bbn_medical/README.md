# Bayesian Belief Network for Medical Diagnosis

This project constructs a Bayesian Belief Network for diagnosing a disease based on symptoms.

## Description

The network models the probability of a disease given symptoms like fever and cough, using Bayes' Theorem for inference.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the BayesianNetwork class and example for medical diagnosis.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python and NumPy are installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 12_bbn_medical`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will compute and print the probability of the disease given different symptom combinations.
