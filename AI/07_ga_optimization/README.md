# Genetic Algorithms for Optimization

This project implements genetic algorithms (GA) for solving optimization problems, specifically maximizing the number of 1s in a binary string.

## Description

The GA includes:
- Population initialization
- Fitness evaluation
- Selection (tournament selection)
- Crossover
- Mutation
- Evolution over generations

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the GeneticAlgorithm class and example usage for binary string optimization.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 07_ga_optimization`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will evolve the population over 50 generations and print the best fitness at each generation, followed by the best solution and its fitness.
