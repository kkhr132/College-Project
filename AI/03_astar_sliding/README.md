# A* Search on Sliding Tile Problem

This project implements the A* search algorithm on a sliding tile (8-puzzle) problem.

## Description

A* uses a heuristic (Manhattan distance) to find the optimal path to the goal state.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the Puzzle class with A* implementation and example usage.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 03_astar_sliding`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will print the solution path if found, or indicate no solution.
