# Fuzzy Inference System for Credit Scoring Application

This project designs and implements a fuzzy inference system for credit scoring based on income, debt, and credit history.

## Description

The system defines fuzzy sets, membership functions, and rules to evaluate creditworthiness, performing fuzzification, inference, and defuzzification.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the fuzzy system implementation and example usage.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python and NumPy are installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 14_fuzzy_credit_scoring`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will compute and print the credit score for sample inputs.
