# Breadth-First Search on a Graph

This project implements breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph.

## Description

BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the Graph class with BFS implementation and example usage.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 02_bfs_graph`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will print the BFS traversal order starting from node 2.
