# Neuro-Fuzzy Model for Control Application

This project implements a neuro-fuzzy model for a control application, such as temperature control.

## Description

The model combines neural networks with fuzzy logic to learn and perform control tasks. It uses Gaussian membership functions and trains the consequent parameters.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the NeuroFuzzyController class and example usage for temperature control.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python and NumPy are installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 10_neurofuzzy_control`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will train the model and print the control output for a test input.
