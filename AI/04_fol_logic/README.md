# First-Order Logic for Knowledge Representation and Inference

This project implements a basic first-order logic system for representing knowledge and performing inference.

## Description

The implementation includes:
- Predicates to represent facts
- Rules for inference
- A knowledge base that stores facts and rules
- Simple forward chaining for reasoning

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the Predicate, Rule, and KnowledgeBase classes, and example usage.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 04_fol_logic`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

The program will demonstrate querying the knowledge base with examples like "Is Socrates mortal?" and "Is Plato human?"
