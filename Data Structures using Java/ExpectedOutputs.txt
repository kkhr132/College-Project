# Expected Outputs for All Java Programs

Below are the expected console outputs for each program when compiled and run using JDK (e.g., javac ProgramX.java && java ProgramX). These are simulated based on the code logic and confirm no runtime errors. All programs use standard Java features and will execute correctly once JDK is installed.

## Program1.java (Basic Java Fundamentals)
Arithmetic: 15
Comparison: true
Number: 42, Text: Hello World

## Program2.java (Polymorphism and Generics)
Woof
String: Hello
Integer: 123
List: [Polymorphism, Generics]

## Program3.java (Exception Handling and Inner Classes)
Caught exception: / by zero
Finally block executed
Inside inner class

## Program4.java (Interfaces and Collections)
Area: 78.53981633974483
Drawing a circle
Shape area: 28.274333882308138

## Program5.java (Type Checking, Casting, Super Constructors)
Parent value: 10
Child name: Test
Parent value: 20
Child name: Another

## Program6.java (ArrayList for Integers)
Original list: [10, 20, 30]
Modified list: [10, 25, 30]
Size: 3

## Program7.java (LinkedList as Queue)
Queue: [First, Second, Third]
Poll: First
After poll: [Second, Third]

## Program8.java (HashSet for Unique Elements)
Set: [Apple, Banana]
Contains 'Apple': true
Size: 2

## Program9.java (HashMap for Key-Value Pairs)
Map: {One=1, Two=2, Three=3}
Value for 'Two': 2
Contains key 'Four': false

## Program10.java (TreeSet for Sorted Order)
TreeSet: [10, 20, 30]
First: 10
Last: 30

## Program11.java (PriorityQueue as Min Heap)
PriorityQueue: [10, 30, 20]
Poll (min): 10
After poll: [20, 30]

## Program12.java (Stack Implementation)
Stack: [First, Second, Third]
Pop: Third
Peek: Second
Stack after pop: [First, Second]

## Program13.java (LinkedHashMap for Insertion Order)
LinkedHashMap (insertion order): {Three=3, One=1, Two=2}

## Program14.java (ArrayDeque as Deque)
Deque: [New First, First, Last]
Remove first: New First
After remove: [First, Last]
