# Java Data Structures and Fundamentals Programs

This repository contains 15 separate Java programs demonstrating various Java concepts and data structures.

## Programs

1. **Program1.java**: Demonstrates basic Java fundamentals such as types, operators, classes, objects, instance variables, methods, constructors, and memory allocation on the heap.

2. **Program2.java**: Illustrates polymorphism through method overriding and demonstrates the usage of generics.

3. **Program3.java**: Demonstrates exception handling using try-catch blocks and illustrates the usage of inner classes.

4. **Program4.java**: Demonstrates the usage of interfaces and illustrates the concept of abstract data types using collections.

5. **Program5.java**: Illustrates type checking, casting, and the usage of super constructors.

6. **Program6.java**: Demonstrates the usage of ArrayList to store and manipulate a list of integers.

7. **Program7.java**: Illustrates the usage of LinkedList to implement a queue.

8. **Program8.java**: Demonstrates the usage of HashSet to store unique elements.

9. **Program9.java**: Illustrates the usage of HashMap to store key-value pairs.

10. **Program10.java**: Demonstrates the usage of TreeSet to store elements in sorted order.

11. **Program11.java**: Illustrates the usage of PriorityQueue to implement a min heap.

12. **Program12.java**: Demonstrates the usage of Stack to implement a stack.

13. **Program13.java**: Illustrates the usage of LinkedHashMap to maintain insertion order.

14. **Program14.java**: Demonstrates the usage of ArrayDeque to implement a deque.

15. **Program15.java**: Illustrates the usage of TreeMap to store elements in sorted order by keys.

## How to Run

Compile each program using `javac ProgramX.java` and run with `java ProgramX`.

For example:
```
javac Program1.java
java Program1
